    <h4>Nodemon</h4>
    <p>
      Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in the source and
      automatically restart the server. Good for development, but not good for
      larger applications or environments that requires lots of memory-load.
      <br />
      <code>npm install -g nodemon</code> - To install globally. <br />
      <code>nodemon app.js</code> - To start the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>nodemon.json</b> shall be added to root of project when using
      <b>SSR</b>, because of only loading the server one time when starting it
      up. This is a performance optimization. <br />
      nodemon as default will NOT watch for changes in files, therefor 'ext'
      tells which extentions to listen to: <br />
      <code>{"ext": "html,js,json,css"}</code>
    </p>
    <h4>Loop methods</h4>
    <p>forEach, map, filter, sort, find and reduce.</p>
    <p>
      Using these loop methods in a functional manner reduces the risk of
      errors, confusion, and unintended side effects. It also makes the code
      shorter and clearer<br />
      for-loops are ONLY for finger counting (counting to a number).

    <h4>Anatomy of an URL</h4>

    <h4>POST requests</h4>
    <p>
      POST requests in Express are handled with the
      <code>app.post()</code> method.
    </p>

      src="/assets/images/post-request.png"
      alt="POST request"
      class="img-fluid mb-3"
    />
    <h4>Body parsing</h4>
    <p>
      When a POST request is sent to the server, the server needs to parse the
      body of the request to get the data.
    </p>
    <p>If the data is JSON the server needs to parse it as JSON.</p>
    <p>
      To parse the body of a request in Express, you need to provide a
      middleware:<br />
    </p>
    <img
      src="/assets/images/body-parsing.png"
      alt="Body parsing"
      class="img-fluid mb-3"
    />
    <p>
      When a POST request is made to the '/example' endpoint, express.json()
      middleware parses the JSON data from the request body, and you can access
      it in your route handler via req.body. This allows you to work with the
      data sent by the client in the POST request.

      <h4>Learning goals:</h4>
      <hr />
      <ul id="learning-goals">
        <li>
          Understands the use case for Nodemon and its limitation for
          development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Can use loop methods (+map, +filter, %reduce). Can choose the right
          one at the appropriate time: We wish to use loop methods and in a
          functional manner (avoiding side effects). for loops are for finger
          counting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Understands why a functional approach to loops is to be preferred and
          how to implement it without side effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Can use the right terminology when it comes to the different parts of
          an URL.
        </li>
        <li>Can make a POST request and handle it in Express.</li>
        <li>
          Understands the need for body parsing and how to do it in Express.
