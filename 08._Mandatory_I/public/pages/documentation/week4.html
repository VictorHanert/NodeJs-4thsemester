    <h4>PUT vs PATCH</h4>
    <p>
      PUT and PATCH are two different HTTP methods that are used to update a
      resource. 
      <br >Use <b>PUT</b> - If you want to update a resource <u>completely</u>.
      <br >Use <b>PATCH</b> - If you want to update <u>only a part</u> of a resource.
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/images/patch-example.png" alt="PATCH" class="img-fluid" />
  <p>
    Here is the PATCH method used to update the drink by its id. <br >
    If the drink is found, it updates the drink with the data provided in the request body. 
    It creates a new object 'drinkToUpdate' by merging the original drink data with the data sent in the request body. 
    Then, it updates the drinks array with the updated drink and sends back the updated drink data as the response.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Delete request</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The DELETE method is used to delete a resource. 
    </p>

  <h4>Time and Date in JS</h4>
  <p>
    The are different ways to get the time and date in JavaScript: 
    <img src="/assets/images/date-example.png" alt="Date" class="img-fluid" />
  </p>
      <p>
        The Date object is used to work with dates and times. 
        Date objects are created with the <code>new Date()</code> constructor:
        <img src="/assets/images/getDays-example.png" alt="Date" class="img-fluid" />
      </p>
    <p>
      We can use the <code>getDay()</code> method to get the day of the week.
      The week starts with Sunday as 0 and ends with Saturday as 6, 
      which can be confusing when we want to display the day of the week to the user.

    <h4>Fetch</h4>
    <p>
      Fetch is used to make requests to a server.
