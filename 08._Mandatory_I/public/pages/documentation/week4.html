    <h4>PUT vs PATCH</h4>
    <p>
      PUT and PATCH are two different HTTP methods that are used to update a
      resource. 
      <br >Use <b>PUT</b> - If you want to update a resource <u>completely</u>.
      <br >Use <b>PATCH</b> - If you want to update <u>only a part</u> of a resource.
    </p>

  <p>
    Here is the PATCH method used to update the drink by its id. <br >
    If the drink is found, it updates the drink with the data provided in the request body. 
    It creates a new object 'drinkToUpdate' by merging the original drink data with the data sent in the request body. 
    Then, it updates the drinks array with the updated drink and sends back the updated drink data as the response.
  </p>
  <h4>Time and Date in JS</h4>
  <p>
    The Date object is used to work with dates and times. 
    <br >Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor.
    <br >There are four ways to create a new date object:
    <br >new Date()
    <br >new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)
    <br >new Date(milliseconds)
    <br >new Date(date string)
