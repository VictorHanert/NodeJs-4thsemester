    <h4>Import and export</h4>
    <p>
      Import and export are two ways to include a module in another module. The
      import statement can be used to import functions, objects, or primitive
      values that have been exported from an external module.
    </p>
    <p>
      The export statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export
      functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be
      used by other files with the import statement.<br />
      There are two types of exports: <b>export default</b> and <b>export</b>.
      The <b>export default</b> is used to export a single value or a function
      from a module. The <b>export</b> statement is used to export multiple
      values or functions from a module.
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML you can use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to import a CSS file
      and the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to import a JavaScript file. The
      script tag can also be used to import a module.
      <code>&lt;script type="module" src="module.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
      <br />
      This tells the browser that the linked JavaScript file (<b>module.js</b>
      in this case), should be treated as a module. Using modules helps organize
      and modularize your JavaScript code, making it easier to manage and reuse
      across different parts of your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Node.js you can use the <b>require()</b> function to import a module,
      which is the CommonJS way of importing modules. When importing express for
      example, we could write: <br />
      <code>const express = require('express');</code> <br />
      The <b>require()</b> function returns the module.exports object, which
      contains all the exports from the module that is being required.
      <br />
      We can also import the express library using the ES6 way of importing
      modules: <br />
      <code>import express from 'express';</code> <br />
      It is the recommended way to import modules in modern JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h4>Serving static files and security needs</h4>
    <p>
      The code <code>app.use(express.static('public'));</code> is used in
      Node.js applications to serve static files such as HTML, CSS and images.
      <br /><b>app</b> refers to an instance of the Express application.
      <br /><b>express.static()</b> is a built-in middleware function in
      Express. It serves static files and is based on the serve-static
      middleware module. <br />
      <b>'public'</b> is the directory from which to serve static assets.
      <br />So, when a request is made to your Express server for a static file,
      Express will look for that file in the "public" directory and serve it (if
      it exists).
    </p>
    <h5>Security</h5>
    <p>
      When serving static files, it is important to consider security when
      publishing the application. If you serve files from a directory that is
      accessible to the public, it is important to be careful not to serve files
      that contain passwords, API keys, or other sensitive data.<br />
      We can prevent it by removing sensitive files from the public directory,
      using .gitignore or by using environment variables to store sensitive
      data.
    </p>
    <h4>Frontend structure</h4>
    <p>
      The frontend structure is the way we organize the assets, pages and
      components in our frontend, which are the static files that are located in
      the public directory. <br />
      A good structure makes the code more readable and maintainable. <br />
      - <b>The assets</b> are the files that are used in the frontend, (images,
      CSS, and JS files). <br >
      - <b>The pages</b> are the HTML files that are served to
      the user. <br />
      - <b>Components</b> are reusable parts of the frontend, such as a header,
      footer, or navigation bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good structure for the frontend is to have a separate directory for
      assets and pages. The assets directory should contain subdirectories for
      images, CSS, and JavaScript files. The pages directory should contain the
      HTML files that are served to the user.

          Understands the security need for serving static files and can do it
          in Express.
        </li>
        <li>
          Can argue for a better way to structure the frontend (assets, pages)
          and how to structure HTML.
