      <h4 id="scoping">Scoping</h4>
      <p>
        Scoping in JavaScript refers to the accessibility of variables.
        In other words, which parts of your program can see or use it.
        There are three types of scopes in JavaScript: global, local, and block.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always use <b>'const'</b> as default when declaring variables.
        <br>
        const is constant NOT in the value, but in the assignment,
        meaning that it cannot be reassigned and thus also HAS to be assigned.
      </p>
      <p>Use <b>'let'</b> when you need to reassign a variable.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'var'</b> is the old way of declaring variables and should be avoided.
      </p>

      <h4 id="advanced-functions">Advanced functions</h4>
      <p>
        Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions.
        '<b>() => {}</b>' - Arrow functions is a short way to write functions in JavaScript.
      </p>
      <img src="/assets/images/week2/callback-function.png"  class="img-fluid mb-3">
      <p>
        The 'genericActionPerformer' function takes "running" as a callback 
        and calls it with a provided name parameter.
      </p>

      <h5 id="package.json">package.json</h5>
      <p>
        The package.json file is the heart of a Node.js project.
        It contains dependencies, metadata about the project, such as the name, version, description, and other details.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a package.json file, you can run <code>npm init</code> in the terminal.
      <ol>
        <li>Then you will be prompted to provide various information about your project, like package name, version,
          description, author, and license. You can fill in these details or just press 'Enter' to accept <b>the default
            values.</b></li>
        <li>After accepting the values for each prompt, <b>npm</b> will display a summary of the information you provided.
          Type "yes" and press 'Enter' to generate the <b>package.json file</b>.</li>
        <li>The package.json file will be in the project directory that contains the metadata and configuration for your
          Node.js project.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <h5 id="express">Express server</h5>
      <p>
        To create a server instance with Express, you can use the following code:
      </p>
      <img src="/assets/images/week2/express-server.png" class="img-fluid mb-3">
      <p>
        The <code>app.get()</code> method specifies a callback function that will be invoked whenever there is an HTTP GET
        request with the path specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>res.send()</code> method sends the HTTP response.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>app.listen()</code> method binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port.
      </p>
      <h5 id="node_modules">node_modules</h5>
      <p>
        The node_modules directory is where npm installs packages.
        It is a subdirectory of the project directory where the package.json file is located.
      </p>
      <p>
        The node_modules directory is not committed to the version control system,
        and it is not deployed to the production environment.
