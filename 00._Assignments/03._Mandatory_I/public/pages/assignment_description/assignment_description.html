  <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Serve the pages with Express.</li>
    <li>
      Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Note: We will cover SSR just before the
      final deadline. Create it as a normal client-side rendered website and
      then refactor later. Do not procrastinate since the refactoring itself
      will take time. Just create it like we create websites so far in the
      course.
    </li>
    <li>Split up the documentation in pages rather than one long HTML page.</li>
    <li>Should have some nice styling (custom or with a styling framework).</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Should cover all the theory that we’ve touched upon.</li>
